If you were following this site for a while, you might have noticed that there is not a lot happening here.
Nobody expected it when we started in 2019 but 2020 was not really a good year for anyone.

I don't need to go into detail because everyone should know what I am talking about.

Anyways... We are back, cancelled a bunch of started things and cleaned up.

Just to start with the following new project:
We are currently on our way to a new World. Currently, not much is clear but yes - we are really building up a world.
Not a physical world, of course but a fantasy world with (hopefully) a bunch of detail and cool background stories.
Once the world is done, we will see what we do with it. It might either be the world for a novel or a game. Or both. Or something completely different.

We will keep you updated here, so stay tuned.

~ Have a nice one!
