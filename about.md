We are 0x4d42, a group of developers that create open source projects on a non-profit basis. As you might expect now, we have full-time jobs and do this as an after-work activity. So if there is nothing happening for some time, there is just no way to do so.

If you want to contact us, please write us an email to hello@0x4d42.eu or join the 0x4d42 Keybase group. We will get back to you as soon as possible.

To become an active member of our group, please be active by submitting pull-requests on one (or more) of our repositories. We will invite you, if your submissions are valuable.
